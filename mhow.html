<h1>Cantonment</h1>
<br>
As early as 1818, the Indian Army has had a presence in Mhow. Up until World War II, Mhow was the headquarters of the [[5th (Mhow) Division|5th Division]] of the Southern Army. According to local legend, [[Winston Churchill]] also spent a few months in Mhow when he was a [[subaltern]] serving with his regiment in India. The house on the mall where he is supposed to have lived, gradually crumbled due to neglect and age. It was pulled down and a jogger's park has been built on its grounds by the Infantry School.

<br>
Mhow houses three premier training institutions of the Indian Army; The Infantry School, The [[Military College of Telecommunication Engineering]] (MCTE) and The [[Army War College, Mhow|Army War College]].
<br>
In addition to these institutes, Mhow is where Army Training Command or ARTRAC was born. ARTRAC was based in Mhow from 1991 to 1994, before it shifted to Shimla ([[Himachal Pradesh]]). At that time its General Officer Commanding in Chief (GOC-in-C) was Lt. General [[Shankar Roy Chowdhary]] who went on to become the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Its first GOC-in-C was Lt. General A.S. Kalkat who had earlier commanded the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka.  ARTRAC was housed in the campus of the present Army School. This was used as All Arms Wing of MCTE for many decades. It was originally built and used as the British Military Hospital (BMH).
